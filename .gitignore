# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# Redis files should not be stored in the repo
*.rdb

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
